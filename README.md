# Gilfoyle-Bitcoin-Alert : <small>Bitcoin is Really Volatile Today</small>

This programme monitors the price of Bitcoin and issues a sound alert when a new All-Time High (ATH) is reached, or if the price falls below a predefined threshold.

## API: CoinMarketCap
The programme uses the CoinMarketCap API to retrieve the current price of Bitcoin. An API key from CoinMarketCap is required, which you can obtain at [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#).

**Note**: If the programme does not execute correctly, try replacing the API key in the source code with your own API key.

## Features
<ul>
  <li>If Bitcoin reaches a new ATH, the programme will play a sound alert using an audio file (by default, a `.wav` file from Napalm Death).</li>
  <li>If Bitcoinâ€™s price drops below a specified threshold, it also triggers an alert.</li>
  <li>The price is fetched in real-time from the CoinMarketCap API.</li>
  <li>The default currency is USD, but this can be modified in the source code as desired.</li>
  <li>The programme checks the Bitcoin price every minute to provide frequent updates.</li>
</ul>
